    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "These tests tell the story that there is a significant difference in call back rate between white and black applicants even when resumes are equal/random for employers. This is clear because the p_value in the bootstrapping method was 0 (i.e. in 10000 permutations that created 10000 different \"diff of mean\" variables when the call back rates were assumed in equal, 0 produced a call back rate as extreme as the from the original data set. Also, the confidence interval at 95% did not include 0 which is another indicator that we can reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this data alone, we cannot conclude that race was the driving factor in the difference of call back rates. Further investigation would be needed. At the very least, we can conclude that employers called back black applicants significantly less frequently than white applicants given that both had the same credentials. It would be beneficial to keep this in mind in our further investigation and carefully examine the correlation between race and any other factors that would also affect call back rate."
